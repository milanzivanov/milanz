        Regards, <br>
        to introduce myself. <br>
        My name is Milan and I graduated in graphical engineering and design. I worked in the printing shop Foto oko  and there I mastered the knowledge of the prepress and CTP work on printers.
        Over the time I became interested in making Web sites and I started educating myself in HTML5,  CSS3, JS,   jQuery,  git,  SCSS,  responsive web layouts,  bootstrap,  foundation,  gulp... which led me to more advanced technology - Angular. Frontend interests me in particular.
