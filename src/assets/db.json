I worked in the printing shop Foto oko and there I mastered the knowledge of the prepress and CTP work on printers. Over the time I became interested in making Web sites and I started educating myself in HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery, git, SCSS, responsive web layouts, bootstrap, foundation, gulp... which led me to more advanced technology - Angular. Frontend interests me in particular."
